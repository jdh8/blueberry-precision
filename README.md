![♠ ♥ ♦ ♣](theme/favicon.svg)

I have been studying forcing club systems since reading *Good, Better, Best* by
Jan Eric Larsson, whose simulations show that forcing club systems tend to
outperform other systems.  I believe opening 1♣ for all strong hands is a
superior treatment.

Blueberry Precision Club is a modernized mix of Blue Club, Precision Club,
Cottontail Club, and new ideas from BTU.  It is a 4-card major strong club
system.  It is highly experimental and subject to change without notice.
