# Natural 1♥

The major suit openings show 11--17 points and 5+ cards.  I separate them into
two chapters due to subtle differences in their continuations.

Responses to 1♥ are similar to natural 2/1 along with mixed fit-showing jumps.

| 1♥-  | 11--17, 5+♥ |
|------|-------------|
| 1♠   | F, 4+♠
| 1NT  | NF, usually 7--11, 0--3♠, 0--3♥
| 2♣♦  | NAT FG
| 2♥   | CONST, 3+♥
| 2♠!  | UNBAL LIM, 3=♥: 6+♠ or 0--1♦♣
| 2NT! | FG, 4+♥
| 3♣♦! | CONST+, 5+#, 4+♥
| 3♥   | LIM, 4+♥
| 3♠!  | SPL, 0--1♠, 4+♥
| 3NT! | Choice of games, 12--15, 33(43)
| 4♣♦! | SPL, 0--1#, 4+♥
| 4♥!  | PRE, UNBAL 4+♥

## 1♥-2♠

| 1♥-2♠ | UNBAL LIM, 3=♥ |
|-------|----------------|
| 2NT!  | Invite 6+♠
| 3♣!   | Invite 0--1♦
| 3♦!   | Invite 0--1♣
| 3♥    | S/O

| 1♥-2♠ 2NT- | Invite 6+♠ |
|------------|------------|
| 3♣♦!       | SPL, 0--1#

## P-1♥

P-1♥ reduces to a fairly natural system.  We can keep using [Stenberg
2NT](1H/2NT.md) because it assigns minimum hands to 3♣.

| P-1♥- | 11--17, 5+♥ |
|-------|-------------|
| 2♣♦   | INV, 5+#
| 2NT!  | INV, 4+♥
| 3♥!   | CONST, 4+♥
