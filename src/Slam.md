# Slam bidding

Slam bidding involves a stack of conventions for various situations.  I list
them from the general to the specific.

- Italian control bids, which promise 2nd round controls
- Non-serious 3NT
- Kickback RKCB 1430

## Optional agreements

- Turbo 4NT for minor suits
- BTU 7-KCB for double fits
- BTU control asking RKCB (conflicts with Exclusion RKCB)
- Exclusion RKCB (conflicts with BTU control asking RKCB)
