# Slam bidding

Slam bidding involves a stack of conventions for various situations.  I list
them from the general to the specific.

## Italian control bids

The famous Italian Blue team devised the Italian style of control bidding.  A 
control can be 1st-round (ace or void) or 2nd-round (king or singleton).  It is
more important to show controls at low steps.  Bypassing a step denies all
controls in that suit.

## Kickback philosophy

## Agreements

- Kickback RKCB 1430
  - Optional Minorwood
- Kickback non-serious 3NT (3♠ for hearts)

## Optional agreements

- Kickback Turbo for minor suits
  - Control bidding supersedes Optional Minorwood
- BTU 7-KCB for double fits
- BTU control asking RKCB (conflicts with Exclusion RKCB)
- Exclusion RKCB (conflicts with BTU control asking RKCB)
