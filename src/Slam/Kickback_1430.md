# Kickback RKCB 1430

RKCB is a powerful modern tool for slam bidding.  It checks quality of trumps
and controls at the same time.  Nevertheless, its location at 4NT can be
inconvenient when the agreed trump is a minor suit.  As per the useful space
principle, the fix is to move RKCB down to 4X+1.  Sometimes, this treatment
conflicts with an existing natural 4Y.  I propose the following algorithm to
resolve where RKCB is.

1. Try interpreting 4♥♠ as natural and non-forcing.
2. Above 4X, the lowest remaining step becomes RKCB.

I choose 1430 over 0314 right after reading the analysis above.

- 4♦{RKCB in ♣} 4♥-4♠
- 4♦{RKCB in ♣} 4♠-4NT
- 4♥{RKCB in ♦} 4♠-5♣
- 4♥{RKCB in ♦} 4NT-5♣

The only case we need to use 4NT for the queen ask is 4♦{RKCB in ♣} 4♠-4NT.
That is far less common than bypassing natural 4♥♠ for RKCB.
